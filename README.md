# ✈️ Wing planform
Draw the wing planform of a wing design using its governing parameters. The quarter chord point of the root chord is taken as the origin of the graph. 

## Use
Put the correct parameters in 'wing_planform.py' and run the program. The parameters that you need are the aspect ratio, the reference area and the quarter chord sweep angle. The relations used to calculate the other parameters are based on Aerospace Courses at TU Delft. These mainly follow from books such as Raymer's.
